## üìñ Project Description 

Journally was completed for the 2024 NWHacks hackathon in Vancouver, BC. Over 24 hours, I worked with a team of 3 other beginner developers to build, from the ground up, our very first web application. Before the event, none of us had ever worked with React before - we were in for one heck of a learning curve!

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Have you ever wanted to write down your feelings and then forget they ever happened?** 

Our motivation behind building a journaling application was our desire to create a product that provided our users with a refreshing journalling experience while still working within the scope of our abilities. We wanted to create a platform that would allow users to partake in cathartic writing exercises without having to commit to a long-term project or worry about managing save data (no one wants their diary shared with the wrong people!). 

Journally allows you to select your current mood and choose what writing format you are in the mood for, and then it will provide you with a tailored writing prompt to respond to. Once you are done, simply send your writing away and enjoy the feeling of emotional catharsis. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

Journally was built with the following technologies:
- React
- CSS
- JSX
- Node.js
- npm v.10.3.0

As a first time react user, the focus for this hackathon project was to develop introductory skills in navigating React's workflow. You will find that the application mainly makes use of component building, the React Router library, and some light logic flow for detecting appropriate prompt types.

## ü§î What I Learned For Next Time

Without a doubt, Journally is a simple application. It's functionality is straightforward, and the UX design needs improvement. I am beyond excited that Journally was dreamed up, React was learned, and the application was deployed within 24 hours. However, here's a list of what I would do if I could remake this application knowing what I know now.

**Quick Fixes**
- Using relative sizing in the CSS styling would allow for a better experience for users who are using Journally with different screen types
- The overall sizing of text and images should be reduced for better readbility
- Better planning of the member variables for each the components would allow for cleaning parameter passing (and would have helped us avoid the biggest bug we had to overcome during development!)

**Bigger Design Changes**
- With more time, I would have liked to build a simple backend that would allow users to create account and to save prompts (if they wished)
- Allowing users to select an array of emotions would let us provide more diverse and well-suited writing prompts

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Closing Thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to read about Journally! Web development is a rewarding and iterative experience - I cannot wait to build on what I learned during this project and continue making better and better web applications.
